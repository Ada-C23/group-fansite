  <h1>Meet the Code & Cake Ladies</h1>

  <section id="about">
    <p>Once upon a semicolon, four legendary ladies — Lady_1, Lady_2, Lady_3 and Lady-4 — found themselves at the intersection of sweet treatsband clean code.</p>

    <p>By daylight, they squashed bugs and crafted beautiful functions. By night, they debated buttercream vs ganache while sipping hot cocoa and reviewing pull requests.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="ladies">
    <p><strong>Lady_1</strong> preferred vanilla pound cake with unit tests.</p>
    <p><strong>Lady_2</strong> couldn’t resist a slice of chocolate lava cake after a long session of debugging.</p>
    <p><strong>Lady_3</strong> was all about carrot cake and semantic HTML.</p>
    <p><strong>Lady-4</strong>? She was the queen of cheesecake and CSS animations.</p>
  </section>

  <p>Together, they created not just web pages, but edible elegance. Some say if you view the source of this site, you can still smell the cake crumbs and see their perfectly nested tags.</p>
