                <p>I met Lulu through a dating app, which was the beginning of an incredible adventure. From the very first moment, there was something about her that felt special â€”- it almost seemed too good to be true! Over the years, I've come to see how her determination to achieve her goals and her deep capacity to love and understand make her truly AWESOME. 
                Lulu has this incredible way of bringing energy, warmth, and a sense of adventure to wherever she goes. She has this amazing ability to read situations and truly understand people, making her someone you can always count on for support, insight, and deep connection. She is also someone who would do anything for the ones she loves.
                Lulu is my wife, my best friend and my life partner, the person who inspires me, and the one who has, without a doubt, made the world a better place.</p>
