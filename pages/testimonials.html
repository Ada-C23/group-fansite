                            Natasha is a friend, a guide, and a spiritual sister, she has blessed my life in ways I never knew I needed. She is a true embodiment of what it means to live freely, love deeply, and lead boldly.
                            A proud first-gen Jamaican American, Natasha has faced life's challenges with grace, strength, and an unshakable commitment to justice and liberation. She speaks from the heart—always open and with purpose—carrying the voices of her ancestors and a deep connection to spirit. Her spirituality is sacred and grounding, and her passion for the liberation of all people oppressed by colonization is a fire that inspires everyone around her.
                            Natasha's dedication to community healing has deep purpose in reconnecting people to their roots, their purpose, and their power. As a spiritual guide in our sangha, she devoted herself to the practice of Buddhism, leading with intention and grace. Her presence in these spaces was not only nurturing but transformative.
                            She is a natural-born leader—decisive, intuitive, and fiercely loving. She lifts those around her and holds space in the most tender and powerful ways. She sees beauty in all things—people, nature, music, movement—and infuses her surroundings with vibrancy and magic. Her sense of music is unmatched; she curates the most perfect ambiance, whether it's a gathering of friends or a moment of stillness. Simply put, wherever Natasha goes, beauty follows.

                            I met Lulu through a dating app, which was the beginning of an incredible adventure. From the very first moment, there was something about her that felt special, it almost seemed too good to be true! Over the years, I've come to see how her determination to achieve her goals and her deep capacity to love and understand make her truly AWESOME.
                            <br><br>
                            Lulu has this incredible way of bringing energy, warmth, and a sense of adventure to wherever she goes. She has this amazing ability to read situations and truly understand people, making her someone you can always count on for support, insight, and deep connection. She is also someone who would do anything for the ones she loves.
                            <br><br>
                            Lulu is my wife, my best friend and my life partner, the person who inspires me, and the one who has, without a doubt, made the world a better place.

                            Collette has a chill, stoic exterior that humbly and discreetly conceals the fact that she’s often the coolest person in the room. There’s an understated brilliance about her that reveals itself the longer you’re around her.
                            <br><br>
                            I say understated because Collette is generally concise with her words and never outright reveals the extent of how well she does something. You kinda just have to experience it. For example, she might casually mention that she’s into matcha and has a matcha business—but I guarantee she left out the part where she’s a matcha GOAT, and her drink recipes are nothing short of art.
                            <br><br>
                            There was a time I was obsessed with cooking with sage, so the kitchen was overflowing with it. One morning, she was experimenting and came up with a drink she called Peppermint Sage. It was a matcha, sage, and mint combo I didn’t know I needed—and it still lives rent-free in my mind.
                            <br><br>
                            Then there was the time she had the brilliant idea to turn her loft apartment into a speakeasy. She created a signature matcha cocktail for the night—an elevated take on a matcha old fashioned. That alone sounds intriguing, but this drink was dipped down. Watching her prepare it was meditative. She garnished it with edible gold flakes on a block of ice and finished it with a spritz of rosewater from a vintage perfume bottle. Excuse me?! And mind you, she’s also the same person who’ll walk into a lounge or club and order ginger or chamomile tea. Lol.
                            <br><br>
                            At her core, she’s an artist and an interdisciplinary one at that. Her ethos is rooted in intention and feeling. All that to say—don’t let her reserved demeanor fool you. She’s wildly dynamic and full of fascinating thoughts and ideas. 10/10 recommend.

                            Growing up with my sister has been the best. She's always been there for me, super patient, and somehow always knows how to make things feel okay. She's the kind of person who remembers the little things that matter and shows up when you need her most. I feel lucky to have her as both my sister and my friend.
