        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter</li>
          <li>1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced</li>
          <li>1 to 2 garlic cloves, minced (about 1 teaspoon, optional)</li>
          <li>3 to 4 whole eggs</li>
          <li>1 cup grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese</li>
          <li>1 pound spaghetti (or bucatini or fettuccine)</li>
          <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Heat the pasta water:</strong> Put a large pot of salted
            water on to boil (1 tablespoon salt for every 2 quarts of water).
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Sauté the pancetta or bacon and garlic:</strong> While the
            water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil or butter in a large
            sauté pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook
            slowly until crispy. Add the garlic (if using) and cook another
            minute. Turn off the heat and transfer the pancetta and garlic to a
            large bowl.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Beat the eggs and half of the cheese:</strong> In a small
            bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the grated cheese.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cook the pasta:</strong> Once the water is at a rolling
            boil, add the pasta and cook until al dente.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Toss the pasta with pancetta or bacon:</strong> When the
            pasta is ready, use tongs to transfer it (dripping wet) to the bowl
            with the pancetta and garlic. Reserve some pasta water. The heat of
            the pasta will help cook the eggs later.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Add the beaten egg mixture:</strong> Once the pasta has
            cooled slightly, add the egg and cheese mixture and toss quickly to
            coat. Add some reserved pasta water to loosen the sauce as needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Season and serve:</strong> Add salt to taste, and serve
            immediately with the remaining cheese and freshly ground black
            pepper. Top with chopped parsley if desired.
          </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>1 1/2 tbsp olive oil</li>
          <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
          <li>1 onion, finely chopped (brown, yellow or white)</li>
          <li>1 lb / 500g beef mince (ground beef) OR half pork, half beef</li>
          <li>1/2 cup (125 ml) dry red wine</li>
          <li>2 beef bouillon cubes, crumbled OR granulated beef bouillon</li>
          <li>800g / 28 oz can crushed tomato (or tomato passata)</li>
          <li>2 tbsp tomato paste</li>
          <li>2 tsp white sugar (if needed)</li>
          <li>2 tsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
          <li>2 dried bay leaves</li>
          <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme (or 1/2 tsp dried thyme or oregano)</li>
          <li>3/4 tsp cooking salt (kosher salt)</li>
          <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Heat oil in a large pot or deep skillet over medium-high heat. Add
            onion and garlic, cook for 3 minutes or until light golden and
            softened.
          </li>
          <li>
            Turn heat up to high and add beef. Cook, breaking it up as your go,
            until browned.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add red wine. Bring to simmer and cook for 1 minute, scraping the
            bottom of the pot, until the alcohol smell is gone.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the remaining ingredients. Stir, bring to a simmer then turn
            down to medium so it bubbles gently. Cook for 20 – 30 minutes,
            adding water if the sauce gets too thick for your taste.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a slow simmer, cover and simmer for 2 – 2.5 hours on very low
            heat, stirring every 30 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cook the pasta in salted water. Reserve some pasta cooking water and
            then toss the pasta with the sauce, adding a bit of the reserved
            water to help coat the pasta.
          </li>
          <li>Serve with Parmesan and chopped parsley if desired.</li>
