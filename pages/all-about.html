            Dik-diks are part of the <em>genus Madoqua</em>, with four main species: Kirk’s dik-dik, Günther’s dik-dik,
            Silver dik-dik, and Salt’s dik-dik.
          </div>
          <div class="fact-card">
            Adults are 30–40 cm tall at the shoulder and weigh 3–6 kg — about the size of a house cat.
          </div>
          <div class="fact-card">
            In the wild, they live 4–5 years, but in captivity, they can live up to 10 years.
          </div>
          <div class="fact-card">
            They live in arid regions across eastern and southern Africa, including savannas and bushlands.
          </div>
          <div class="fact-card">
            Dik-diks form lifelong monogamous pairs and share a small, defended territory for their whole lifetime.
          </div>
          <div class="fact-card">
            They use scent from preorbital glands to mark their territory by rubbing on twigs and grass to create
            boundaries
            that other dik-diks avoid.
          </div>
          <div class="fact-card">
            Their long snouts cool blood through a network of nasal passages, helping them survive hot, dry climates.
          </div>
          <div class="fact-card">
            Dik-diks feed primarily on leaves, fruits, shoots, and herbs. They get most of their water from food and
            rarely
            need to drink.
          </div>
          <div class="fact-card">
            Their predators include eagles, leopards, jackals, and pythons. They rely on speed, camouflage, and agility
            to
            survive.
          </div>
          <div class="fact-card">
            They make a distinctive alarm call — a sharp “zik-zik” sound — which is how they got their name. It serves
            as a
            warning signal.
