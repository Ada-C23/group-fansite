    <li>
      <strong>Species and Classification</strong><br />
      <span class="highlight">Dik-diks are part of the *genus Madoqua*, with four main species: Kirk’s dik-dik, Günther’s dik-dik, Silver dik-dik, and Salt’s dik-dik.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Size and Weight</strong><br />
      <span class="highlight">Adults are 30–40 cm tall at the shoulder and weigh 3–6 kg — about the size of a house cat.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Lifespan</strong><br />
      <span class="highlight">In the wild, they live 4–5 years, but in captivity, they can live up to 10 years.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Habitat</strong><br />
      <span class="highlight">They live in arid regions across eastern and southern Africa, including savannas and bushlands.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Monogamous Behavior</strong><br />
      <span class="highlight">Dik-diks form lifelong monogamous pairs and share a small, defended territory for their whole lifetime.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Territorial Marking</strong><br />
      <span class="highlight">They use scent from preorbital glands to mark their territory by rubbing on twigs and grass to create boundaries that other dik-diks avoid.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Heat Adaptations</strong><br />
      <span class="highlight">Their long snouts cool blood through a network of nasal passages, helping them survive hot, dry climates.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Diet</strong><br />
      <span class="highlight">Dik-diks feed primarily on leaves, fruits, shoots, and herbs. They get most of their water from food and rarely need to drink.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Predators and Survival</strong><br />
      <span class="highlight">Their predators include eagles, leopards, jackals, and pythons. Dik-diks rely on speed, camouflage, and agility, and they escape threats by blending into the brush and staying alert.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Communication</strong><br />
      <span class="highlight">They make a distinctive alarm call — a sharp “zik-zik” sound — which is how they got their name. It serves as a warning to their mate or nearby dik-diks.</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
