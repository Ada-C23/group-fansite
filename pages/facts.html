        <h2>0.0 Python was started as a hobby project</h2>
        <p >How many of you know Python began as a time pass project for a programmer during his summer holidays? Guido van Rossum&comma; one of the world&sbquo;s most famous computer programmers&comma; was looking for an interesting project during the Christmas holidays in 1989. There was a thought in his head to create a new scripting language that would be the descendant of ABC and be appealing to Unix/C hackers. A few years later&comma; in 1991&comma; he developed Python&comma; which is said to have succeeded ABC.</p>

        <h2 >0.1 Python is named after a TV show</h2>
        <p >Python seems like an odd name for a programming language. There is no truth to the popular belief that Python is named after the famous non&ndash;venomous snake of the same name. It has a whole different story to tell. Guido was a huge fan of “Monty Python&sbquo;s Flying Circus”&comma; a comedy TV show on the BBC. Back in the 70s&comma; Monty Python was a renowned British comedy group that performed in British colonies. In honor of Monty Python&sbquo;s Flying Circus&comma; Guido decided to name the language Python&comma; since he was a big fan.</p>

        <h2 >0.2 The Python programming language is older than Java</h2>
        <p >Over the past decade&comma; Python has become a very popular programming language. It appears that Python has attracted and strengthened its listeners since it started out as a new language. <br> <br>
        Here&sbquo;s the interesting truth: Python is a much older programming language than Java. The first Python version was released in 1991&comma; whereas the first Java version was released in 1995. Even though Python is 30 years old&comma; it still stands strong.</p>

        <h2 >0.3 Python Anti&ndash;Gravity</h2>
        <p >When you type import antigravity in the Python Interpreter&comma; Python gives you this easter egg. You will then be taken to a website with a comic&ndash;style image of a stick figure named Python flying. Check it out for yourself. Here&sbquo;s the import code you can run on your Python interpreter or console.</p>

        <h2 >0.4 Special Slice Operator in Python</h2>
        <p >The Python programming language has a special slice operator that makes it very unique compared to other programming languages. This operator can perform various tasks&comma; such as shortening a list&comma; getting the last and the first numbers&comma; etc. I have provided a code example below to better understand this interesting operator.</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Example Code:</h5>
        <br>
        <code id="example-code">
          list = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30,35] <br>
          <br>
          #Here we are shortening a list <br>
          print(list[:-5]) # [5, 10] <br>
          <br>
          #Here we are reversing a list <br>
          print(list[::-1]) <br> <br>

          Output: 
          <br>
          
          [5, 10] <br>
          [35,30,25,20,15,10,5] <br>
