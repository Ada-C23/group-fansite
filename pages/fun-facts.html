    <ul>
        <li><strong>Yes, they're really called "dik-diks"</strong><br>
            Not a joke. That's the actual name. It comes from the squeaky "dik-dik!"" noise they make when scared. Nature
            has a sense of humor. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>They're cat-sized drama queens</strong><br>
            They're as tall as a housecat, but they strut around the savanna like they own the place. Tiny royalty. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Their eyes take up half their face</strong><br>
            Their eyes are so big it's like they just saw how much rent costs in New York. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>They cry... fashionably</strong><br>
            The black streaks under their eyes aren't from watching sad movies — they're scent glands. But hey, it’s a
            look. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>They have air conditioners for noses</strong><br>
            Their long snoots cool the air as they breathe — built-in AC. Dyson could never. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Married for life — no ghosting here</strong><br>
            Once a dik-dik finds a partner, that's it. Forever. They don't even take breaks — one leaves, the other
            stands guard like a security camera. 
        </li> 
        <li><strong>They poop in family bathrooms</strong><br>
            Dik-diks use shared poop piles. Yep. Communal toilets. It's a bonding experience. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>They're scared of... basically everything</strong><br>
            A falling leaf? Panic. A sneeze? Panic. Their own reflection? Probably also panic. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>They look like plush toys with anxiety</strong><br>
            Honestly, if you saw one on a shelf at IKEA, you'd assume it was a stuffed animal named Smölfrän. 
        </li>
        <li><strong>Their survival plan: stay hidden forever</strong><br>
            If the savanna was a party, the dik-dik would be hiding behind the couch with snacks. 
        </li>
