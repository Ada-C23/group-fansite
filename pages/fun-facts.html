      <strong>YES, THEY'RE REALLY CALLED "DIK-DIKS"</strong><br>
      <span class="highlight">Not a joke. That's the actual name. It comes from the squeaky "dik-dik!" noise they make
        when scared. Nature has a sense of humor.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>They're cat-sized drama queens</strong><br>
      <span class="highlight">They're as tall as a housecat, but they strut around the savanna like they own the place.
        Tiny royalty.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Their eyes take up half their face</strong><br>
      <span class="highlight">Their eyes are so big it's like they just saw how much rent costs in New York.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>They cry... fashionably</strong><br>
      <span class="highlight">The black streaks under their eyes aren't from watching sad movies — they're scent glands.
        But hey, it’s a look.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>They have air conditioners for noses</strong><br>
      <span class="highlight">Their long snoots cool the air as they breathe — built-in AC. Dyson could never.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Married for life — no ghosting here</strong><br>
      <span class="highlight">Once a dik-dik finds a partner, that's it. Forever. They don't even take breaks — one
        leaves, the other stands guard like a security camera.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>They poop in family bathrooms</strong><br>
      <span class="highlight">Dik-diks use shared poop piles. Yep. Communal toilets. It's a bonding experience.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>They're scared of... basically everything</strong><br>
      <span class="highlight">A falling leaf? Panic. A sneeze? Panic. Their own reflection? Probably also panic.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>They look like plush toys with anxiety</strong><br>
      <span class="highlight">Honestly, if you saw one on a shelf at IKEA, you'd assume it was a stuffed animal named
        Smölfrän.</span>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Their survival plan: stay hidden forever</strong><br>
      <span class="highlight">If the savanna was a party, the dik-dik would be hiding behind the couch with
        snacks.</span>
    </li>
